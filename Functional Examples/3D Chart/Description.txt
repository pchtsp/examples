This example illustrates some of the possibilities of the 3D Chart in AIMMS. Like the 2D chart, the 3D chart supports different styles: bar, scatter, and surface. In this example only the surface style is used.

The slider object is also used in this example. With the slider you can assign a value to a scalar parameter. 

The second 3D Chart example is based on the Complementarity Model example available in the AIMMS Language Reference, Chapter Mixed Complementarity Problems, section COMPLEMENTARITY VARIABLE declaration and attributes. 

Keywords:
