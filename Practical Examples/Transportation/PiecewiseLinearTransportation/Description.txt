Piecewise linear transportation

Problem type:
MIP (small)

Keywords:
Piecewise linear, special ordered set, SOS2, network object.

Description:
The Piecewise Linear Transportation problem models a simple transportation model
with one complication, namely the objective function representing the cost is a
piecewise linear function. This piecewise linear cost function is used to model
price discounts. The piecewise linear function is modelled using the integer
linear programming trick of Chapter 7.6 of the AIMMS Optimization Modeling
book.

Note:
The Piecewise Linear Transportation problem is described by Christensen and
Labbe (2015) but the model formulation in this project differs from their
formulation.
