This example illustrates a personnel planning problem and its corresponding multi-period model. An airline company must decide how many flight attendants to hire and train over the next six months. The model includes a (stock) balance constraint which is typical in multi-period models involving state and control type decision variables. A time lag notation is introduced for the backward referencing of time periods. 

Initially, a simplified formulation of the model is solved and it is shown that rounding a fractional linear programming solution can a good alternative to using an integer programming solver. Finally, the full model complete with random variables is considered and an approach based on the use of probabilistic constraints is presented.
