An airline company must decide how many flight attendants to hire and train over the next six months. The model includes a (stock) balance constraint which is typical in multi-period models involving state and control type decision variables. A time lag notation is introduced for the backward referencing of time periods.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Initially, a simplified formulation of the model is solved and it is shown that rounding a fractional linear programming solution can a good alternative to using an integer programming solver. Finally, the full model complete with random variables is considered and an approach based on the use of probabilistic constraints is presented.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Consider the following personnel planning problem. The personnel manager of an airline company must decide how many new flight attendants to hire and train over the next six months. Employment contracts start at the beginning of each month. Due to regulations each flight attendant can only work up to 150 hours a month. Trainees require two months of training before they can be put on a flight as regular flight attendants. During this time a trainee is effectively available for 25 hours a month. Due to limited training capacity, the maximum number of new trainees each month is 5.</div><div><br></div><div>Throughout the year, flight attendants quit their jobs for a variety of reasons. When they do, they need to notify the personnel manager one month in advance. The uncertainty in the number of resignations in future months, makes it difficult for the personnel manager to make long term plans. In the first part of this example, it is assumed that all the leave notifications for the next six months are known. This assumption is relaxed at the end of the chapter. </div><div><br></div><div>This example contains the following information. At the beginning of December, 60 flights attendants are available for work and no resignations were received. Two trainees were hired at the beginning of November and non in December. The cost of a flight attendant is $5100 a month while the cost of a trainee $3600 a month. The flight attendant requirements in terms of flight hours for the months January to June are presented on the <a href=\\\"Input data\\\">Input Data page</a>. Furthermore, the number of resignations per month are also presented on the Input Data page. </div><div><br></div><div>Keywords:</div><div>Linear Program, Integer Program, Control-State variables, Rounding Heuristic, Probabilistic Constraint.</div><div><br></div><div>Navigation:</div><div><a href=\\\"Input Data\\\">Input Data</a></div><div><a href=\\\"Solve\\\">Solve</a></div><div><br></div>\"",
