Their requirements vary throughout  the year for different crop activities. In this chapter all requirements will be specified on a monthly basis, and are assumed to be known with certainty. </div><div>Crop rotation is the practice of growing different crops, in sequence, on the same land. The specification of all relevant crop rotations and time shifts in real-world application is a non-trivial task, and requires the aid of an agronomist. See the tab <a href=\\\"Input Data/Land\\\">Land</a> under Data Input for an overview of the tables.</div><div><br></div><div>Labor is an another major requirement for crop activities, and is supplied by the farmer's family as well as outside workers. The use of labor is dis-aggregated over the year, because labor is employed for different activities requiring different intensities. For each crop pattern there will be as set of labor requirements that vary each month. </div><div>In addition to the already available family labor, outside workers can be hired as permanent workers or temporary workers. Permanent faily labor consists of 1. person, and costs $ 4144 per man for an entire year. Permanent outside labor costs $ 5180 per man for a year, while temporary labor is $ 4 per hour. The corresponding table can be found under <a href=\\\"Input Data/Labor\\\">Input Data/Labor</a>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The last major requirement for the agricultural production is water. This can either be supplied from surface water distribution or from groundwater.  In this example it is assumed that the water available to the farmer is each month is restricted tot 5 kcub. Furthermore, there is an overall annual limit on the use of water equal to $ 50 per year. The cost of water is fixed for the entire year and amounts to $ 10 per kcub. The crop water requirements for the farm are given under the tab <a href=\\\"Input Data/Water \\\">Input Data/Water</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>Keywords:LP, Linear Program, Measurement units, Sensitivity analysis, What-If analysis.</div><div><br></div><div>Navigation:</div><div><a href=\\\"Input Data\\\">Input Data</a></div><div><a href=\\\"Output Data\\\">Output Data </a></div><div><a href=\\\"Sensitivity Analysis\\\">Sensitivity Analysis </a></div>\"",
